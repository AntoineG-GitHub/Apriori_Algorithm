                                                  Project 1: Implementing Apriori


      This project is focused on the Apriori algorithm which aims to find the frequent itemsets in a dataset given a fixed
      minimum support. The Apriori algorithm is the most basic join-based algorithm for frequent itemset mining. It
      exploits the anti-monotonicity property and uses a level-wise approach. Many optimisations have been proposed
      to improve the performances of the basic implementation. In this project, you will have to implement a variation of
      the algorithm and compare its performances with another frequent itemset miner.
